overRideIpsecSecrets: {}

# enablePodSNAT: Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) allows pods running in the cluster to communicate with the on-premises
# network over the VPN without exposing the pod subnet range. SNAT changes the IP address of packets sent by the pod
# application from the pod subnet to the private IP address of the worker node on which the pod is running.
#   "true"  = Enable SNAT
#   "false" = Disable SNAT
#   "auto"  = Automatically enable SNAT if the pod IP subnet is not listed in local subnets
enablePodSNAT: "auto"

# enableRBAC: Enable the creation of strongSwan service account, roles, rolebinding, clusterrole, and clusterrolebinding resources.
# This option must be set to 'true' if you want to install strongSwan in a namespace other than 'kube-system'.
# If this option is set to 'false', the namespace argument will be ignored; 'kube-system' will always be used.
#   true  = Enable the creation of RBAC resources
#   false = Disable the creation of RBAC resources ('kube-system' namespace will be used)
enableRBAC: true

# enableServiceSourceIP: Sets the 'externalTrafficPolicy' field of the strongSwan Kubernetes service to "Local".
# This option should only be enabled if IKEv1 key exchange (ipsec.keyexchange=ikev1) is being used for the outbound VPN
# connection (ipsec.auto=start) and the 'connectUsingLoadBalancerIP' option was specified as "true" or "auto" (and the
# option 'loadBalancerIP' was specified).
#   true  = Enable source IP on the Kubernetes service
#   false = Disable source IP on the Kubernetes service
enableServiceSourceIP: false

# enableSingleSourceIP: Enable a single source IP address for all traffic from the cluster over the VPN connection.
# If this options is enabled, the 'local.subnet' option MUST be configured as a single /32 IP address.  This IP address will be
# used as the single source IP for the cluster.  All traffic sent over the VPN connection must be initiated by the cluster.
# Inbound requests over the VPN to the cluster are not allowed.  Additional restrictions include:
#  - the 'local.subnet' option must be a single /32 IP address
#  - the 'localSubnetNAT' option must be blank / not specified
#  - the 'enablePodSNAT' option must not be set to "false"
#
#   true  = Enable single source IP address for the VPN connection
#   false = Do not enable single source IP logic
enableSingleSourceIP: false

# (Optional) localNonClusterSubnet: Specify the list of non-cluster subnet CIDRs to expose over the VPN connection.
# Use the localNonClusterSubnet option if you are using the strongSwan IPsec VPN service Helm chart as a gateway as
# part of an on-prem or local cluster deployment and you want to expose resources which are not exposed directly on
# the cluster itself. Specifying these subnets ensures that remote connections are able to make requests and receive responses
# from those resources. Masquerade rules will be added to the worker to ensure that the non-cluster resources can respond correctly over the VPN.
# If specified, you must also add the list of localNonClusterSubnets to the local.subnet list so that they are configured in the ipsec.conf as accessible subnets.
# Do not include any subnets used by the workers in the cluster.
localNonClusterSubnet:

# (Optional) localSubnetNAT: Network Address Translation (NAT) for subnets provides a workaround for subnet conflicts
# between the local and on-premises networks. You can use NAT to remap the cluster's private local IP subnets,
# the pod subnet (172.30.0.0/16), or the pod service subnet (172.21.0.0/16) to a different private subnet
# so that the VPN tunnel sees remapped IP subnets instead of the original subnets.
# Remapping happens before the packets are sent over the VPN tunnel as well as after the packets arrive from the VPN tunnel.
# You can expose both remapped and non-remapped subnets at the same time over the VPN.
#
#  Examples:
#   localSubnetNAT: 10.171.42.0/25=10.10.10.0/25
#       --OR--
#   localSubnetNAT: |-
#     10.171.42.17/32=10.10.10.2/32
#     10.171.42.29/32=10.10.10.3/32
#     10.171.42.46/32=10.10.10.4/32
#       --OR--
#   localSubnetNAT: |-
#     10.171.42.0/25=192.168.168.100/32
#     172.21.198.196/32=192.168.168.101/32
#
# - The first example remaps 1-to-1: all of the IP addresses in the 10.171.42.0/25 subnet are mapped over to 10.10.10.0/25
# - The second example only remaps three IP addresses: 10.171.42.17, 10.171.42.29, and 10.171.42.46 are mapped over to
#   10.10.10.2, 10.10.10.3, and 10.10.10.4 respectively.
# - The third example does a SNAT for all of the IP addresses in 10.171.42.0/25 to the single IP address of 192.168.168.100.
#   The SNAT is one direction, out of the cluster. This means the 10.171.42.0/25 subnet can not be accessed from the remote network.
#   The service located at 172.21.198.196 is available to the remote network and can be accessed using 192.168.168.101.
#
# If you use this setting, the local subnet that should be exposed over the VPN connection is the subnet AFTER the "=".
localSubnetNAT:

# (Optional) remoteSubnetNAT: Network Address Translation (NAT) for subnets provides a workaround for subnet conflicts
# between the local and on-premises networks, or multiple overlapping on-premise networks. You can use NAT to remap
# on-premises private subnets to a different private subnet so that the cluster workloads see the remapped IP subnets
# instead of the originals. Remapping happens before the packets are sent over the VPN tunnel as well as after the packets
# arrive from the VPN tunnel. You can expose both remapped and non-remapped subnets at the same time over the VPN.
#
#  Examples:
#   remoteSubnetNAT: 10.1.1.0/24=172.20.1.0/24
#       --OR--
#   remoteSubnetNAT: |-
#     10.1.1.3/32=172.20.1.1/32
#     10.1.1.6/32=172.20.1.2/32
#
# Subnets listed on the left of the "=" are the original subnets and must exactly match individual entries in the remote.subnet list.
remoteSubnetNAT:

# (Optional) loadBalancerIp: The portable public IP address that you want to use for the strongSwan VPN service for inbound VPN connections.
# If this field is set, you must use a public portable IP address from a subnet assigned to this cluster.
# If this field is not set, the cloud provider uses a free public IP address.
#
# If the VPN connection is initiated from the on-premises gateway (ipsec.auto is set to 'add'),
# this property allows a persistent public IP address to be configured on the on-premises gateway for the cluster.
loadBalancerIP:

# connectUsingLoadBalancerIP: Use the Load Balancer IP that is indicated in 'loadBalancerIP' to establish the outbound VPN connection.
# If this option is enabled, then all of the cluster worker nodes must be on the same public VLAN or you must use the 'nodeSelector'
# setting to ensure that the VPN pod is deployed on a worker node on the same public VLAN that the 'loadBalancerIP' is associated with.
# This option is ignored if ipsec.auto='add'.
#   "false"   - Do not connect the VPN using the Load Balancer IP.  Use the public IP address of the worker node where the VPN pod is running.
#   "true"    - Establish the VPN using the Load Balancer IP as the local source IP.
#               If 'loadBalancerIP' is not configured, the external IP address assigned to Load Balancer service is used
#   "auto"    - Set to 'true' if ipsec.auto='start' -AND- 'loadBalancerIP' is set
connectUsingLoadBalancerIP: "auto"

# (Optional) nodeSelector: To limit which nodes the strongSwan VPN pod deploys to, add the IP address
# of a specific worker node or a worker node label. The deployment spec for the VPN pod will update
# with this value for the nodeSelector.
#
#  Examples:
#   nodeSelector:
#     kubernetes.io/hostname: 10.184.110.141
#       --OR--
#   nodeSelector:
#     strongswan: vpn
#
# - The first example restricts the VPN pod to running on that worker node only. If the VPN pod is restricted to a
#   single node and that node is not available, the VPN will be down.
# - The second example restricts the VPN to running on any worker nodes with that label.
#   You can use any node label, but it is recommended to use: 'strongswan: <release name>'
#   so that different worker nodes can be used with different deployments of this chart.
#
# If the VPN connection is initiated by the cluster (ipsec.auto is set to 'start'), this property can be used
# to limit the source IP addresses of the VPN connection that is observed by the on-premises gateway.
nodeSelector: {}

# privilegedVpnPod: Run the strongSwan VPN pod with privileged authority.  Normally this is not required.
# An error message logged by the VPN pod will indicate when privileged authority is required.
#   true  = Run the VPN pod with privileged authority
#   false = Run the VPN pod with NET_ADMIN authority
privilegedVpnPod: false

# A comma separated list of tests that should run during `helm test` or 'ALL' to run them all
# The test names are:
#   check-config     - Checks for a valid ipsec config
#   check-state      - Checks for an ESTABLISHED tunnel status
#   ping-remote-gw   - Checks that we can ping the remote VPN gateway
#   ping-remote-ip-1 - Checks that we can ping the remote.privateIPtoPing from the pods' IP range
#   ping-remote-ip-2 - Checks that we can ping the remote.privateIPtoPing from the workers' IP range
#
# Example:
#  helmTestsToRun: check-config,check-state,ping-remote-ip-1
helmTestsToRun: ALL

# (Optional) tolerations: To allow the strongSwan route DaemonSet to run on worker nodes that are tainted, add tolerations.
#
#  Examples:
#   tolerations:
#     - operator: Exists
#       --OR--
#   tolerations:
#     - key: dedicated
#       operator: "Equal"
#       value: "master"
#       effect: "NoSchedule"
#     - key: dedicated
#       operator: "Equal"
#       value: "proxy"
#       effect: "NoSchedule"
#
# - The first example allows the route daemon to run on all worker nodes. Taints are essentially ignored.
# - The second example allows the route daemon to run on worker nodes that have 'dedicated="master"' or
#   the 'dedicated="edge"' taints.
#
# NOTE: Do not force the route daemon to run on tainted worker nodes unless routes need to be added on those worker nodes.
tolerations: []

# strongswanLogging: Control which strongSwan components generate logging data and at what level.

# logging for 'cfg', 'dmn', and 'ike' components, and reduce the logging that is done by 'net' component (log level '0').
# For a complete list of the strongSwan components and logging levels, see: https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/LoggerConfiguration
# NOTE: The 'ike' component must be specified as '2' or a higher logging level for the VPN routes to be configured correctly.
